      The RECOMB Conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a 
      scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology 
      and their applications in molecular biology and medicine.<P>
      
      The conference series aims at attracting research contributions in
      all areas of computational molecular biology. Typical, but not exclusive,
      the topics of interest are:<P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI> Genomics,
      <LI> Molecular sequence analysis,
      <LI> Recognition of genes and regulatory elements,
      <LI> Molecular evolution,
      <LI> Protein structure,
      <LI> Structural genomics,
      <LI> Gene Expression,
      <LI> Gene Networks,
      <LI> Drug Design,
      <LI> Combinatorial libraries,
      <LI> Computational proteomics,
      <LI> Structural and functional genomics.
      </UL><P>
      
      The origins of the conference came from the mathematical and computational
      side of the field, and there remains to be a certain focus on computational
      advances. However, the effective use of computational techniques to
      biological innovation is also an important aspect of the conference.<P>
      
      The conference had a growing number of attendees, topping 300 in recent
      years. We are preparing for up to 450 participants in 2001.<P>
      
      The conference program includes between 30 and 40 contributed papers, that
      are selected by a international program committee with around 30 experts
      during a rigorous review process rivaling the editorial procedure for
      top-rate scientific journals. In previous years papers selection has been
      made from up to 130 submissions from well over a dozen countries. 10-page
      extended abstracts of the contributed papers are collected in a volume
      published by ACM Press and available at the conference. Full versions of
      a selection of the papers are published annually in a special issue 
      of the Journal of Computational Biology devoted to the RECOMB 
      Conference.<P>
      
      A further point in the program is a lively poster session. Around 120
      posters have been presented at RECOMB 2000.<P>
      
      One of the highlights of each RECOMB conference is a collection of nine
      keynotes awarded to researchers of highest international esteem who are
      asked to inform the community about landmark advances in computational and
      experimental research and inject new directions into the field of
      computational molecular biology.
      This includes the following conference events:<P>

      The<i> Stanislaw Ulam Memorial Computational Biology Address</i>:
      awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions
      in the computational aspects of the field.<P>

      <UL>
      <LI> The<i> Distinguished Biology Lecture</i>:<BR>
           awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major
           contributions in the biological aspects of the field.
      <LI> The<i> Distinguished New Technologies Lecture</i>:<BR>
           describing emerging, new technologies.
      </UL><P>

      In addition RECOMB features the <br>
      <UL>
      <LI> <i> Best Paper by a Young Scientist</i> Award:<BR>
          This award will be given to the best paper written solely
          by one or more recent graduates or students. An abstract is
          eligible if all authors are recent graduates (within 3
          years from Ph.D.) or full-time students at the time of
          submission.
