The Fifth Annual Conference on Research in Computational Molecular
Biology (RECOMB 2001), sponsored by the Association for Computing
Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory
(ACM-SIGACT) with support from Celera Genomics, Compugen, IBM
Corporation, SLOAN Foundation, International Society for Computational
Biology (ISCB), SmithKline Beecham, US Department of Energy, and US
National Science Foundation will be organized by Centre de recherches
mathématiques, Université de Montréal, in Montreal, Canada on April
22-25, 2001. The conference will be held at the Montréal Wyndham
Hotel.


Papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and 
experimental) in all areas of computational molecular biology are 
sought, including surveys of important recent results/directions.

Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

Genomics
Molecular sequence analysis
Recognition of genes and regulatory elements
Molecular evolution
Protein structure
Gene expression
Gene networks
Combinatorial libraries and drug design
Computational proteomics
Structural and functional genomics

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION:

Authors are encouraged to submit their abstracts ELECTRONICALLY. 
The respective email address is 

                 recomb01@sigact.acm.org

Electronic submission instructions can be found at 

       http://sigact.acm.org/~recomb01/RECOMB2001.html

Authors who are unable to do so are requested to send 10 copies 
(preferably two sided copies) to:

          Thomas Lengauer
          Program Chair RECOMB 2001
          Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing
          GMD - German National Research Center for Information Technology
          Schloss Birlinghoven
          53754 Sankt Augustin
          Germany
          Tel: +49 2241 14 2777
          Fax: +49 2241 14 2656
          email: recomb2001@gmd.de

Abstracts must be received by September 30, 2000, 23:59 local time. 
This is a firm deadline. Simultaneous submission to another 
conference or journal is allowed. Authors are asked to inform the 
program chair at the time of submission of the simultaneous 
submission.

The deadline for submission to RECOMB 2001 has been extended 
to Oct 5, 2000 23:59 middle European time. 

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS:

The extended abstracts for the Conference will be published by ACM 
Press and will be available at the Conference. If the paper has been 
accepted to another conference or a journal before RECOMB 2001, the 
authors will be allowed only a short abstract (1 page) in the 
proceedings of RECOMB 2001 and not an extended abstract.
A selection of the accepted extended abstracts in their final journal 
versions will be invited to appear in a special issue of the Journal 
of Computational Biology devoted to RECOMB 2001.

NOTIFICATION:

The conference submissions will be refereed by the program committee. 
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by a letter 
mailed on or before December 8, 2000. A final copy of each accepted 
paper is required by January 5, 2001. An author of each accepted 
paper is expected to attend the Symposium and present the paper; 
otherwise alternative arrangements should be made to have the paper 
presented.

ABSTRACT PREPARATION:

An abstract should start with a succinct statement of the problem, 
the results achieved, their significance and a comparison with 
previous work. This material should be understandable to 
non-specialists. A technical exposition directed to the specialist 
should follow. The length, excluding cover page and bibliography, 
should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript should be easy to read, 
using at least 11 point font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch 
paper with no less than one inch margin all around. If authors 
believe that  more details are absolutely necessary to substantiate 
the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix. 
An email address for the contact author should be included. 
Abstracts that deviate significantly from these guidelines risk 
rejection without consideration of their merits.

POSTERS:

RECOMB 2001 will include a poster session. Accepted posters will 
appear in a special poster book published by the Centre de recherches 
mathématiques. Poster submission instructions will be announced later.

CONFERENCE EVENTS:

RECOMB 2001 will feature 9 Plenary Lectures (to be announced later) 
including the following conference events:

  -  The Stanislaw Ulam Memorial Computational Biology Address:
     awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions in 
     the computational aspects of the field.

  -  The Distinguished Biology Lecture:
     awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions in 
     the biological aspects of the field.

  -  The Distinguished New Technologies Lecture:
     describing emerging, new technologies.

  -  Best Paper by a Young Scientist Award:
     This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or 
     more recent graduates or students. An abstract is eligible if all 
     authors are recent graduates (within 3 years from Ph.D.) or full-time 
     students at the time of submission. This should be indicated in a 
     letter to the program chair that accompanies the submission. The 
     program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among 
     several papers.

  -  The Conference occasionally awards the "Fred Howes Distinguished 
     Service Award Lecture" in recognition of exceptional service on 
     behalf of the Computational Biology community.
