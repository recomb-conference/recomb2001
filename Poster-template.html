  <P> <FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="+1"><B> Introduction </B></FONT>
  <P> Poster abstracts should be submitted electronically. The abstracts of accepted 
    posters will be published in book form and will be available at the meeting. 
    The following instructions are intended to maximize space available to authors 
    while ensuring agreeable and consistent appearance, efficient handling and 
    timely publication. Final posters may, of course, be in any format, as long 
    as they fit onto a 4 by 8 foot board. Acceptance of an abstract is conditional 
    on at least one of its authors preregistering for RECOMB electronically before 
    March 1 (see <A HREF=http://recomb2001.gmd.de>http://recomb2001.gmd.de</A>) 
    along with an <A HREF=Poster-template.tex>abstract template</A> ( <A HREF=Poster-template.tex>LaTeX</A>, 
    <A HREF=Poster-template.ps>Postscript</A>, <A HREF=Poster-template.pdf>PDF</A>, 
    <A HREF=callforposters.doc>Word</A>). Abstracts must be received by January 
    22, 2001; authors will be notified about acceptance before February 5, 2001. 
    In the case of files we cannot open or which do not satisfy the format instructions, 
    we will try to notify the authors within a few days of receipt to allow for 
    resubmission. Authors who cannot comply with software or e-mail instructions 
    should notify <a href="mailto:posters@crm.umontreal.ca">posters@crm.umontreal.ca</a>well 
    in advance of the deadline. 
  <P> <FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="+1"><B> Software and files </B></FONT>
  <P> The abstract, written in clear and reasonably grammatical English, must 
    be submitted in exactly the same format as the example in the templates, and 
    should fit on two pages, everything included. If at all possible, use LaTeX 
    2e article document class, with all the default options, and with a minimum 
    of other packages and other files. Download the template file provided. To 
    conserve space, do not split the abstract into many small sections. 
  <P> For those for whom LaTeX is impossible, use Word or other easily translatable 
    word-processing software. Download the Word template and substitute your own 
    text, titles and headings, conserving the same fonts, sizes and styles. 
  <P> Submit the LaTeX source file (or Word file), and either a postscript version 
    or a .pdf version, or both. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:posters@crm.umontreal.ca">posters@crm.umontreal.ca</a>as 
    attachments. The subject header of each message should identify the paper 
    by the first author's surname and the type of file it contains. Authors submitting 
    more than one abstract should disambiguate them using numerals. E.g. smith1.tex, 
    smith1.ps, smith2.tex, smith2fig1.eps, smith2.pdf, smith2.ps, smith3.doc. 
  <P> <FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="+1"><B> Figures and tables </B></FONT>
  <P> Use standard LaTeX figure and table environments. Make sure figures are 
    readable and not too crowded. Do not use type sizes smaller than <B>footnotesize</B> 
    in figures and tables. No colour please. For LaTeX submissions, figures must 
    be composed in LaTeX or incorporated in the text using .eps files. 
  <P> Figures in Word submissions must be incorporated in the abstract, or sent 
    as .eps files. In any case, they must appear properly positioned in .ps and 
    .pdf files. 
  <P> Use the general format in Figure 1, if possible (For LaTeX code follow the 
    link)

    of the two-page limit.
