The utility of most drugs prescribed today for common,
complex diseases is limited by a still rudimentary
understanding of the molecular basis of disease as well as
of drug action. At the heart of this is our current
inability to account for inter-individual differences in
disease etiology and drug response. These inter-individual
differences are determined, to a large extent, by inherited
predispositions and susceptibilities. Knowledge of the
genetic differences that explain these individual
characteristics, and based upon it, the development of
specific diagnostics and therapeutics, will therefore be
critical for the successful transition to a future progress
in health care.

<P>
The impact of genetics and genomics will leave its mark along all steps involved in the creation of a new medicine: 
<UL>
<LI> in the discovery of new targets that carry -inherently,
     because genetic linkage implies causation-a greater
     likelihood of success; 
<LI> in the discovery phase of a new
     drug aimed at an existing target, where the knowledge of
     molecular variation of this target (SNPs) may provide clues
     to achieve higher selectivity; where genetic epidemiology
     studies will provide added value by validating the target;
     and where large scale gene expression profiling (gene chips)
     will help select compounds with a higher likelihood for
     ultimate success at an early stage; 
<LI> and in the
     development phase of an drug undergoing clinical evaluation,
     where pharmacogenetic studies, and genotype-specific patient
     selection may allow recognition and definition of
     drug-responders and non-responders, or help decrease the
     likelihood of adverse events.

<P>
Although the impact of genetic and genomic investigation
will certainly accelerate progress in biomedical research,
we believe it will do so in an evolutionary fashion, and as
a logical extension of the history of medical progress
towards a more detailed understanding of disease and the
resultant more refined differential diagnosis as well as
more accurate prospective risk assessment. If any, the
fundamental change we are going to witness in the years to
come is a (paradigmatic) shift from today's largely clinical
disease definition and diagnosis to a molecular definition
and diagnosis of disease. This shift is likely to greatly
increase the importance of in-vitro diagnostics and will
mandate, much more than is the case today, an integrated
approach of diagnostics and therapeutics. Ultimately, we
expect to derive the benefit of more successful, and more
cost-effective medicines, and of possibly being able to
prevent (or delay), rather than treat disease.

<P>
It is important to realize that genetic research and testing
are areas of great public concern, and that a more
comprehensive dialogue between scientists and the public is
urgently needed to address the societal, ethical, legal
issues that are being raised. Only then will we be able to
truly take advantage of the significant advances in medical
knowledge that genetic research will make possible, and
fully realize the potential of these approaches towards the
ultimate goal of all our striving, improving the human
condition.
