    The sequence of vertebrate genome is expressed by RNA splicing 
    producing mRNA. Interpreting the genome requires understanding the 
    sequences recognized by the nuclear factors and spliceosome in 
    executing removal of introns.
    The status of this area of science will be reviewed.
    Conversely, genome sequences can be searched for 
    sequences which specify RNA splicing and are common of many genes.
    The availability of genome sequences from a variety of species will 
    make the latter approach much more powerful.
    The recently discovered RNA interference (RNAi) process is
    evolutionarily old and related processes are important for
    control of expression of repetitive genes in some organisms.
    RNAi can be initiated by conversion of double strand RNA into
    21-23 nucleotide RNAs which can base pair with mRNAs and direct
    their cleavage.
    These short RNAs may also direct silencing of genes by other
    mechanisms.
    Over half of the genome of many organisms is composed of
    repetitive sequences and it is possible that RNAi may silence
    these sequences.
