   <P>
   The core agenda of post-WWII molecular biology has been defined as the 
   molecular understanding of how genetic information was transmitted and read 
   out (see for example Stent 1968), and, by the 1950's, the analogy between the tape 
   in a Turing machine and the linear sequence of nucleotides in DNA was 
   apparent to both computer scientists and biologists.  
   
   <P>
   In the early 21st century, it may be that molecular biology can fruitfully 
   return to return to these roots, by recasting part of its agenda in terms of the 
   need to understand how biological information is processed.  In a somewhat 
   more modern formulation, cells can be thought of as machines that process and 
   make decisions on three kinds of information: 1) information stored in the 
   genome 2) information about intracellular events (for example from checkpoint 
   mechanisms) and 3) information external to the cell.  
   
   <P>
   In many cases the machinery that cells use to make decisions is reasonably 
   well understood at a qualitative level.  However, in no case do we possess a 
   corresponding quantitative understanding, and, reflecting this, nor are we very 
   capable of predicting the outcomes of perturbations to the genome, the internal 
   workings of the cell, or its external environment.  
   
   <P>
   One path to understanding the behavior of these ensembles of components 
   clearly lies in construction of mechanism-based quantitative models representing 
   cellular processes.  Building such models requires solution of numerous 
   computational and experimental biological challenges.  I will detail some of 
   these, and progr.  
   
   <P>
   Another path may involve computation on the qualitative biological 
   knowledge that now exists.  Expert biologists reason on this qualitative 
   information to make statements about the consequences of perturbations, but 
   expert systems that do the same in the main do not exist.  Here, although the 
   need is clear, the relative opacity (to me) of much of the seemingly relevant 
   computer science literature has made it more difficult to figure out first steps.  
   
   <P>
   Finally, note that information theory (Shannon 1948) has it roots in the 20th 
   century need to understand transmission of electrical signals through channels.  
   It is not immediately clear that the representations of biological processes used 
   by biologists map well to concepts that come from this theory.  To give only one 
   example, one is hard pressed to define or find, inside a cell that is processing 
   signals from the outside, either the signal or the "bits" (Tukey, 1946) that might 
   make it up. There may be thus be an opportunity here for new theory to guide 
   thinking and further experiment.
