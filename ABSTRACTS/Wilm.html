   The ability to identify proteins with mass spectrometry has a profound
   impact on biological research. Its long term effects can only be compared
   with the significance the PCR enzyme had for the advancement of biological
   science.
   
   <P>
   Suddenly proteins can be identified having only minute quantities
   available. The efforts invested into the technology lead to a constant
   increase in throughput - comparable to the development of DNA sequencing
   technology.
   
   <P>
   Biological mechanisms can be studied directly on the protein level. There
   are two research directions: protein expression based proteomics and cell
   mapping or functional proteomics.
   
   <P>
   Protein expression based proteomics is focussing on the understanding of
   cellular states by analyzing the protein expression level of as many
   proteins as possible. In cell mapping experiments the protein - protein
   interaction network within a cell is analyzed.
   
   <P>
   At the EMBL a protein complex purification technique, called tandem
   affinity purification (TAP), was developed which allows to rapidly purify
   very specifically non covalently interacting proteins which can be
   subsequently analyzed with mass spectrometry (cell mapping approach). The
   complexes assemble in vivo, are purified as such and characterized. The
   technique had been developed in yeast and efforts are under way to
   establish similar methods in higher eukaryotes. The comparison of this
   technique with similar experiments based on two hybrid screens demonstrate
   that the protein based approach is more specific and functional data
   suggest that it is more complete. This may be due to the fact that the
   complexes assemble first in their native environment and are then pulled
   out for characterization.
 
   <P>
   The organization of all the proteins into groups of physically interacting
   proteins is an important step towards understanding their functional role
   within a cell. To a large degree cellular processes organize themselves
   based on the non-covalent affinity of proteins. Protein based approaches as
   exemplified by the tandem affinity purification method in conjunction with
   mass spectrometry are very important in analyzing this functional infra
   structure. The identification of all the proteins involved in a particular
   biological mechanism and the characterization of their interaction
   constants may provide the physical data to simulate the process by a
   computer.
