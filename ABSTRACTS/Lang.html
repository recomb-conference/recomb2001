   With genomic data (generated by classical, functional,
   structural, proteo- and other 'omic' approaches) accumulating
   at a stupendous rate, there is an ever increasing need for the
   development of new, more efficient and more sensitive computational
   methods. To highlight aspects of our computational needs, we will
   present results that emerged from the comparative genome analysis
   of mitochondria. Having originated from an alpha-proteobacterial
   endosymbiont, these eukaryotic organelles contain small and
   extremely variable genomes, and are thus perfect model systems
   for the much more complex eubacterial and archaeal genomes. We
   are currently investigating mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) in a
   lineage of unicellular, primitive protistan eukaryotes, the
   jakobids, with the aim to understand the evolution of mitochondrial
   genomes, genes and their regulation. Because these organisms are
   difficult to grow, biochemical approaches aimed at understanding
   gene regulation are laborious, thus it is possible to capitalize
   considerably from predictions on genome and gene organization, and
   regulatory elements. Contrary to approaches in which molecular data
   (gene order, sequence similarities) are used to infer the phylogenetic
   relationships among a group of organism, we know their phylogeny and
   employ this information to identify and model more or less conserved
   genetic elements and structural RNA genes that are difficult to spot by
   conventional methods, in a phylogenetic-comparative approach.
